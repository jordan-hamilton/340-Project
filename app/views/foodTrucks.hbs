        <td>Biker Jim’s craveable concept pimps 15 gourmet sausages, ranging from wild boar and Alaskan reindeer to pheasant cordon bleu and an award-winning vegan dog. Toppings are limited only by your imagination, and we have a killer condiment bar with all the fixings, including locally made Elevation ketchup. Our proprietary dogs, served on fresh-baked-rolls, and sourced from the best purveyors, are plump and juicy, ridiculously good and a whole lot of fun to eat.</td>
